Question--> What is Graph?
Answer--> A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links.
		  The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, 
		  and the links that connect the vertices are called edges.
		  
-->	Graph Data Structure
	Mathematical graphs can be represented in data structure. We can represent a graph using an array of 
	vertices and a two-dimensional array of edges. 
	
	
 some important terms −

-->Vertex − Each node of the graph is represented as a vertex. 
-->Edge − Edge represents a path between two vertices or a line between two vertices. 
-->Adjacency − Two node or vertices are adjacent if they are connected to each other through an edge.
-->Path − Path represents a sequence of edges between the two vertices.
