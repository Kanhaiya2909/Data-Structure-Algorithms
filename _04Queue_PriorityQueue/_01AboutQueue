Question--> What is Queue?
Answer-->  A queue is a linear list of elements in which deletion of an element can take place only at 
		   one end called the front and insertion can take place on the other end which is termed as the rear. 
		   The term front and rear are frequently used while describing queues in a linked list.
		   
	  -->  the first element to be inserted in the queue will be the first element to be deleted or removed from the list. 
	       So Queue is said to follow the FIFO (First In First Out) structure. 
	       A real-life scenario in the form of example for queue will be the queue of people waiting to accomplish a particular task
	       where the first person in the queue is the first person to be served first.
